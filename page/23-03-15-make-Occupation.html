Whether for the lack of demand or the changing of times, this project represents uncovering those lost processes and reimagining them applied to western clothing fashions of that time.</p><h6>#1. Constructed on flat</h6><div class="img-hover-text float-start px-3"><img src="https://realmatic.com/assets/michelle/media/23-03-05-make-qipao-1.png"><div class="overlay"><div class="text"><i>diagram based on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB7j4RBtYqM'>this guide</a></i></div></div></div><p class='ps-5'>Western tailoring methods involve constructing with the 3D in mind. The idea of smoothly curving around the body, around the limbs, in order to make a garment. This results in darts, armscyes, and some strange shapes, copied over and over as patterns. However, traditionally, Chinese clothing is measured on flat. Key measurements -- i.e. of bust, waist, hips, arm length, etc... -- is all that is needed to directly cut the fabric. One just has to connect the dots with a slight bit of curve and that is all. In this way, only one continuous piece of fabric is cut out.</p><p class='ps-5'>I based my measurements on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=dB7j4RBtYqM'>this tutorial</a> with some changes: adding a dart, changing the flap opening shape, lengthing the spine, etc...</p><p class='ps-5'>Darts came into fashion in the in-between period of Shanghai’s occupation, as a way to partially address the excess of fabric that falls over the bust. In lighter fabrics, the excess creases would be small and varied--being somewhat less distracting. However, since my fabric was extremely heavy, darts were a necessity in order to corral the fabric to lay properly. Although not strictly “traditional,” it is an intersection with western making practices.</p><h6>#2 Steam warping</h6><p class='ps-5'>Western principles dictate that fabric be cut on grain and many lengths take to make sure that piece does not stretch out. However, the making of a qipao inherently requires redistribution of the waist. Since the difference between the bust and waist is only taken at the sides, the fabric will not lay properly down the front or back (or exaggeratedly across the sides). This redistribution is achieved by warping the fabric off its grain, pulling the negative wedge across the bias and loosening the fibers of the fabric with steam. It feels tedious and like nothing is happening, but it eventually does change. In this way, the garment becomes 3D.</p><h6>#3. Applying <i>jianghu</i></h6><p class='ps-5'><i>Jianghu</i> is a paste made out of low-gluten rice flour and water. Just like wheat pasting, <i>Jianghu</i> uses the inherently sticky properties of flour to make a glue to stop the edges of a fabric from fraying. It doesn’t keep for long, but it’s strong, cheap, and washes out easily. There are many ways of making jianghu. In my method, I boiled water and added it in small portions to the flour. Once it formed a big chunk, I covered it with hot water and let it soak for a minute, then drained it. I would repeat this process until it is smoothed.</p><p class='ps-5'>To apply <i>jianghu</i>, you basically smear it across the fabric, much like printing with a silk screen. With a squeegee like object (like an expired credit card), I scraped it on. Once dried, the fabric becomes somewhat starched, and has little to no fraying. Although jianghu is a traditional technique, I can totally see myself using it on finicky fabrics on all sorts of projects.</p><p class='ps-5'>I mainly followed <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyhxgA2vTK0'>this tutorial</a>.</p><h6>#3.5. Bias binding</h6><p class='ps-5'>Bias binding has historically decorated all sorts of Chinese clothing. Not only can it bind raw seams and hems, it has the ability to twist and curve into all sorts of fancy shapes. <i>Jianghu</i> is applied to an entire width of fabric. It takes awhile, and I definitely should have taken more breaks than I did. Then, it is just a matter of cutting the fabric on the 45 degree angle and creating bias binding at the desired width. I used the “continuous bias method,” which simplifies the cutting/sewing processes. This bias binding was then first tacked on by machine, then folded over and sewn on by hand.</p><h6>#4. Three-tiered cape</h6><p class='ps-5'>Usually capes are made by gores, triangle-shaped pieces that form a cone-like shape (like an umbrella). However, I wanted to approach this cape with the Chinese perspective--one continuous piece that drapes around the body. I originally thought that a cape layer would be a circle, but it’s more like an oval. The difference is the length of the shoulder. The neckhole was cut out in the same dimensions as the main qipao pattern.</p><center><img src="https://realmatic.com/assets/michelle/media/23-03-05-make-qipao-2.png"></center><p class='ps-5'>In order to draw the ellipse at the correct dimensions, I found the foci and then traced them with some string and chalk. Though probably just basic math principles, I found <a href='https://www.docgreenwoodturner.com/ellipse.html'>this website</a> to explain the process clearly.</p><h6>Further considerations</h6><p class='ps-5'>Many articles of Chinese traditional clothing feature extensive embroidery as well as narrow bias binding decorations. I was intending to embroider the inside of the coat--another method of hiding--and adding western-inspired bias binding swirls, but unfortunately ran out of time.</p><p class='ps-5'>Originally, I was considering the narrative of the carp jumping Dragon’s Gate, one of the most common tales of perseverance. However, I also came across the symbolism of a burnt peony. In the middle of winter, the Empress commanded that all the flowers in the garden bloom by the next morning. All the flowers did, except for the peony. Enraged, the Empress had them burned and exiled from the palace. From there, the peony only flourished. It is probably a fair bit over embellished, but the moral of the story remains of perseverance in the face of adversity.</p><p class='ps-5'>For the narrow bias binding decorations, instead of the traditional gentle wave pattern, I was planning on creating more western-like swirls. Like a fleur-de-lis in a loop form. Though mainly decorative, it would point toward a more obvious historic influence.</p><div class="row my-5"><div class="col-md-2"></div><div class="col-md-3 nowrap">&larr; <a href="/page/23-05-01-make-Deliberate/">Newer Work</a></div><div class="col-md-2"></div><div class="col-md-3 text-right nowrap"><a href="/page/22-12-13-make-Vigor">Older Work</a> &rarr;</div><div class="col-md-2"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-2"></div></div></div><!-- end of container --><!-- Footer --><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><hr><ul class="list-inline text-center"><li class="list-inline-item"><a href="https://github.com/MichelleStudio" target='_blank'><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fab fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li class="list-inline-item"><a href="https://dribbble.com/MichelleStudio/collections"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa-brands fa-dribbble fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><!--- li class="list-inline-item"><a href="www.linkedin.com/in/Michelle-R-Chen" target='_blank'><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li ---><li class="list-inline-item"><a href="https://sketchfab.com/MichelleStudio" target='_blank'><img class='image-fluid' style='opacity:1' src="https://realmatic.com/assets/michelle/media/sketchfab-logo-recolor.png" width='40px'></a></li></ul><p class="copyright text-muted text-center">&copy; MichelleStudio.github.io 2020 - 2023</p></div></div></footer><!--Footer--></body></html>
